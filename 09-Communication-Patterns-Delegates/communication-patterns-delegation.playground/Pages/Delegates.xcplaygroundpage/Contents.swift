 # Delegation
 
 Delegation is one of many communication patterns used in iOS to distribute information.
 Delegation is one-to-one, which means that only two participants can engage in delegation
 */

/*:
 
 When creating a delegate, we only want a blueprint of the contract; functions that describe what information is being passed from the delegate

//:  ### Setting the bus's delegate to be the bus control center, which conforms to the BusStopDelegate
bus.delegate = controlCenter

// Let the bus take off
bus.takeOff()
bus.reachedDestination()

//: Lets take a look at how this looks like in a diagram

/*:
 ### **Note**
 
 We declare the delegate as *weak* because of some issues with creating a retain cycle, a common problem when using delegates.

   We will learn about dealing with this in the next lessons
