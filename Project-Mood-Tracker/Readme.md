# Project - Mood Tracker

In this project we are going to be creating at an to track the moods of friends. The app allows you to manage a list of friends in a UITableView and update their moods. A friend can either have a good (😁), a medium(😑) or a bad(😡) mood.

Think of the communication pattern lessons when building this project.

**HINT**: You might need to create a few data models

There is no persistence requirement for this project, if you close the app, its ok for the list of friends to disapear.

## Requirements

You should be able to:

- [x] Add friends one at a time to a UITableView
- [x] Tap on a friend in the UITableView and set the mood of a friend

Bonus:

- [x] Delete a friend
