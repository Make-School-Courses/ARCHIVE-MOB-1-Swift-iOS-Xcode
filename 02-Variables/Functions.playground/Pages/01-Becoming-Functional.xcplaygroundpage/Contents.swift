 # Becoming Functional
 ## An Introduction to Functions

 Now that you have some control over variables, it's time to move on to _functions_. _Functions_ are chunks of code that you can reuse by _calling the function_. You will be working with a special drawing tool throughout most of this Playground. The pictures will start off simple and build up in complexity as you learn more and experiment.

 ## Let's call a function!

 We're going to jump right into things so you can call your first function. Enter the following line of code and watch the visualization to see what happens!

    moveFifty()

 What can we infer about _function calls_ from the line above?

 ## Anatomy of a function call

 A _function call_ looks a lot like a variable but it has parentheses after it. Function calls take the form of:

    functionName()

 In this case, you called a function named `moveFifty`. What happened in the visualization? You should have seen the triangle move `50 units` and leave behind a line.

 It's important to keep in mind that functions (like variables) must be defined before they are called. We have already defined the `moveFifty()` function for you in another file. `moveFifty()` will work anywhere but you cannot just call `moveThirty()` and expect it to work. A `moveThirty` has not been defined yet. We'll show you how to define your own functions soon but let's focus on calling them for now.

 - experiment: What happens if you call the `moveFifty` function again in the space below? What happens if you call it a third time?


 - important: _Make sure each function call is on a separate line and don't forget the parentheses!_

 */






/*:

 ## What happened?

 Every time you call `moveFifty` the function's code is executed another time. With 3 calls in a row to `moveFifty` the triangle should move `150 units` in a straight line and leave a path behind it.
