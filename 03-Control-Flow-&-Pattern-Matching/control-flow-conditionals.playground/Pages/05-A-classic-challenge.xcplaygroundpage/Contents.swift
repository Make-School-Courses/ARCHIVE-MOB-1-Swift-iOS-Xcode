 # Fizz Buzz

 There is a classic childrens game called [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) used to teach children division. The rules are simple:

 - callout(Rules of Fizz Buzz): While counting from 1 to 100...

     - If the number is divisible by 3, say _Fizz_
     - If the number is divisible by 5, say _Buzz_
     - If the number is divisible by 3 & 5, say _Fizz Buzz_
     - Otherwise, say the number

 The game _Fizz Buzz_ is actually a classic programming problem! We're going to implement a slightly different version here.

 ## Make School: a FizzBuzz alternative

 Instead of _Fizz_ and _Buzz_, we'll be using _Make_ and _School_.

 - callout(Challenge): Modify the `for` loop below to...

     - Print _Make_ if the number is divisible by 3
     - Print _School_ if the number is divisible by 5
     - Print _Make School_ if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
     - Otherwise, print the number

for i in 1...100 {
    // Implement Make School here!

}
//: [Previous](@previous)

 - callout(Hint): The logic in the rules might not be in the right order for your `if` statements!
