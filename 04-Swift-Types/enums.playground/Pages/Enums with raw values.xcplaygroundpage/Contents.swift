 ### Challenges
 
 1. Model a type called `CardinalDirection` using an `enum`. What could be the different _values_ for this type?
 2. Write a function called `help`, that takes a value of type `CardinalDirection` and returns a `String`. This function is supposed to help a lost ship on an ocean to find its way back home (it needs to go north-east). The return value of the function should indicate whether the value that was passed in helps the ship to get home. Use an *arrow unicode character* (`→`, `←`, `↑`, `↓`) in the returned `String` to illustrate the direction on a map, e.g.: `This direction (↓) does not help the ship to get home.`
 3. Model a type called `Month` using an `enum`. That type should represent all the different months in one year. 
 4. Write a function that returns a `String` and indicates at which position this month is inside a year, e.g.: `March is the 3rd month of the year`.
